Pre-release - in progress
    - Decoupled the OpenQASM parser and GoogleTest from the main codebase, now
      they are submodules, https://github.com/softwareQinc/qasmtools and
      https://github.com/softwareQinc/googletest, respectively. The OpenQASM
      parser submodule is now common to both staq and Quantum++, and by default
      uses standard OpenQASM gate definitions in Quantum++. To switch to Qiskit
      definitions (which are also the usual ones used in QC textbooks),
      configure the project with `cmake -DUSE_QISKIT_SPECS=ON`. For a list of
      discrepancies between Qiskit and standard OpenQASM, please see the newly
      added ["DISCREPANCIES.md"] file. DO NOT FORGET to clone the repository
      with `--recursive` (or `--recurse-submodules`), i.e.
      `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/softwareqinc/staq`.
      Alternatively, type `git submodule update --init` if you didn't clone the
      repository recursively.
    - Added CMake installation support
    - Switched continuous integration from Travis CI to CircleCI
    - CMake minimum required version bumped to 3.12 for automatic unit tests
      detection by CMake
    - Unit testing is now a separate CMake target, one needs to explicitly type
      'make unit_tests' to build the unit testing suite
    - Simplified unit testing, now one can run tests with 'ctest' or
      'make test' (after explicitly built with 'make unit_tests'). Use
      'GTEST_COLOR=1 ARGS="-V" make test' or 'GTEST_COLOR=1 ctest -V' for
      coloured verbose testing output.
